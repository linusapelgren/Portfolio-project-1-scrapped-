      <h1>Nutrition</h1>
      <h2>Starting Words</h2>
      <p>Nutrition plays a pivotal role in optimizing training performance and achieving fitness goals.<br><br>A well-balanced diet rich in macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and healthy fats provides the necessary fuel for workouts while aiding in muscle repair and recovery.<br><br>Carbohydrates serve as the primary energy source, fueling intense training sessions, while proteins are crucial for muscle repair and growth.<br><br>Additionally, adequate hydration is essential for maintaining optimal performance and preventing dehydration during prolonged exercise.<br><br>Micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals also play vital roles in various physiological processes, including energy metabolism and immune function, further emphasizing the importance of a diverse and nutrient-dense diet.<br><br>Proper nutrition not only enhances physical performance but also supports overall health and well-being, making it an indispensable component of any training regimen.</p>

      <h2>Bulking and Cutting</h2>  
      <p>Bulking and cutting are key phases in muscle building and fat loss journeys.<br><br>It's recommended to adjust calorie intake by approximately 10% from your Basal Metabolic Rate (BMR).<br><br>The BMR formula for men is: BMR = 88.362 + (13.397 × weight in kg) + (4.799 × height in cm) - (5.677 × age in years), and for women: BMR = 447.593 + (9.247 × weight in kg) + (3.098 × height in cm) - (4.330 × age in years).<br><br>This adjustment helps support muscle growth during bulking and fat loss during cutting phases efficiently.</p>
      <p class="sidenote">Remember, activity levels also impact calorie needs. If you're more active, you may need more calories to maintain or gain weight, while less active individuals may require fewer calories. Adjustments can be made based on your activity level to ensure you're meeting your goals effectively.</p>
      <p>Protein intake is also a very important part of your diet and it is recommended to eat around 0,8-1 grams of protein per lb of bodyweight.</p>
      <p>Another way to approach the cut is by this formula that is featured in one of Jeff Nippards videos.</p>
      <p><strong>CALORIES:</strong> BODYWEIGHT (LBS) X 10-12.</p>
      <p><strong>PROTEIN:</strong> GOAL BODYWEIGHT (LBS) X 0.8-1.</p>
      <p><strong>FAT:</strong> 50 GRAM MINIMUM PER DAY</p>
      <p><strong>CARBS:</strong> REMAINING CALORIES.</p>

      <h2>Helpful Tips</h2>
      <p>Proteinshakes are very helpful to ensure you are reaching your protein needs as they are relativalely low calorie and high protein <br><br> It is also recommended to always weigh your food and keep a journal of everything you eat, <br> excel is a great way to do this since it can calculate everything for you</p>
